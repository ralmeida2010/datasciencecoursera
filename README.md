This is the final project of the Scientist Toolbox training. The objective is to estimate and evaluate the relationship between the FWI meteorological index and the number of daily forest fires in mainland Portugal (NIR variable). For this forecast, information from the FWI meteorological index (Fire Weather Index) must be used, represented by the daily average of all points on the ERAS5 grid of the ECWMF model (FWI variable) and the following data from the previous day, Number of forest fires ( variable NIRAnt), Sum of total burned area (Variable AAant) and FWI (variable FWIAnt). The data used is public and is provided by the Institute for Nature Conservation and Forests of Portugal (<https://www.icnf.pt/florestas/gfr/gfrgestaoinformacao/estatisticas>).

For the final project work the question is: "Is it possible to estimate the Number of daily forest fires based on the daily Fire Weather Index and with data from the previous day regarding the Daily Number of Fires, total burned area and Fire Weather Index?":

The primary objective is to employ a predictive model that needs to be assessed on a randomly selected 30% of the data. The model will be iteratively executed 1000 times to utilize the mean values of the parameters.
